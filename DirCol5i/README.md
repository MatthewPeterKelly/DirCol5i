# DirCol5i -- README

Quick documentation:

## How do I install this code?

Just make sure that this directory is on the Matlab path.
Once that is all set, you should be able to run any of the demo code or type `>> help dirCol5i` for more information.

## How do I solve a trajectory optimization problem?

Once this directory is on the Matlab path, type `>> help dirCol5i` for details. An alternative is to open `dirCol5i.m`
and read the help there.

## Demo:

There are several examples in the `demo` directory, each in its own sub-directory. In all cases the entry-point script has the prefix `MAIN`.

## autoGen_*.m

Several files start with the prefix `autoGen_`. These files are automatically generated by the Matlab symbolic toolbox.
